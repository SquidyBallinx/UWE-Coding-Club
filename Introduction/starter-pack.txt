Welcome Coding Club Members!

To start:
  Create a GitHub account
    So you can create, share and collaborate on projects

  Download GitHub Desktop
    Link: https://desktop.github.com/
    This is available for Mac and Windows, and saves you from understanding
      what Git is and Git command line (scary stuff!)
    Sorry Linux users, you will have to use Git in command line :(

  Become a GitHub Student (optional)
    Link: https://education.github.com/
    You can get LOADS of discounts and free software as a student
    You can also get private repositories to only be available to people you want to see
    Just have a read of it and see how important it can be!
