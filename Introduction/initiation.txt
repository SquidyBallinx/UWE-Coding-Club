  Ok now save the changes and go back into GitHub Desktop
    Go into repo and into the changes bar
    Give a summary and a description and commit the changes
    Finally sync the changes, this will save the code all the way onto GitHub!

  Next you will learn is a pull request
    A pull request is where you ask other collaborators for feedback

    Using GitHub Desktop or GitHub, create a pull request
      Give a description that you have added your name and what your name was
    Anyone will review your request, and make any changes
      This is a great place to talk about your code and why you've made these changes
    Finally the pull request can be merged (or closed).
