# Introduction
======
Hello Coding Club Members!
Here is the introduction of Coding Club and what we will do today (the Taster Session)

- [ ] How to use github, and why we will be using this! (ALSO GitHub Student!)
- [ ] do some projects/challenges on HackerRank!

problem is the introduction stuff didnt come out as a text file to update otherwise it would have been okay
this led to alot of confusion.

but i think i understand how this works might be wise to explain it to the others.
